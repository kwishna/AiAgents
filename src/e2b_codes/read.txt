The E2B Sandbox is a small isolated VM the can be started very quickly (~150ms).
You can think of it as a small computer for the AI model. You can run many sandboxes at once.
Typically, you run separate sandbox for each LLM, user, or AI agent session in your app.
For example, if you were building an AI data analysis chatbot, you would start the sandbox for every user session.
